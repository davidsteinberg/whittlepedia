# Whittlepedia

Whittlepedia is a browser extension that filters Wikipedia pages down to just
links, allowing for rapid exploration. A new Show/Hide button fixed at the top
of the screen allows you to see a page's full text when you want to read about a
specific topic.

The top languages on Wikipedia's main page have Google-translated "Show" and
"Hide" button text. Help making them more correct or adding other languages is
welcome!
